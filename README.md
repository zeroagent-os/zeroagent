# ZERO AGENT

**Your personal AI agent. No coding required.**

Free forever. Self-hostable. Community owned.

⭐ If you believe everyone deserves their own AI agent — star this repo and help us build it.

## What is ZERO AGENT?

ZERO AGENT gives anyone their own personal AI agent — without writing a single line of code.

You sign up, get your agent, browse skills from across the internet, install the ones you need, and run them from a simple dashboard. Your agent does exactly what you tell it to do, when you tell it to do it.

Think of it as an **app store for AI agents** — but the apps come from everywhere. skills.sh, GitHub, npm, or any URL on the internet. You're never locked into one source.

---

## How it Works

```
1. Sign up at zeroagentos.com
2. Get your personal agent (starts with zero skills)
3. Browse skills from across the internet
4. Install the ones you need — one click
5. Run them from your dashboard
6. Get results — no code, no complexity
```

You are always in control. Your agent only does what you tell it to do.

## Real Example

Meet Sara. She runs a small online store and has zero coding knowledge.

She signs up, gets her agent, and installs three skills:

- **Product Price Tracker** — monitors competitor prices
- **Customer Review Summariser** — turns 50 reviews into a 5 line summary
- **Daily Sales Report** — emails her a clean report every morning

She clicks Run when she needs them. Her agent does the work. Done.

She never writes a single line of code. She never opens a terminal. She just logs in and uses it.

**That's ZERO AGENT.**

## Install Skills From Anywhere

ZERO AGENT is a universal runtime. Skills can come from anywhere on the internet:

```bash
# From the ZERO AGENT marketplace
zeroagent install skills:price-tracker

# From skills.sh

# From GitHub
zeroagent install github:username/skill-name

# From npm
zeroagent install npm:zero-skill-analytics

# From any URL
zeroagent install https://github.com/anthropics/skills --skill frontend-design
```

Every skill in the dashboard shows exactly where it came from — no hidden sources, no black boxes.
