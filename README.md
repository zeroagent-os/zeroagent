## What is ZERO AGENT?

ZERO AGENT is a foundational platform that lets you build, run, and manage AI agents — without being locked into any proprietary system.

Every agent starts from zero. You install the skills it needs, nothing more. Skills can be added, updated, or removed at runtime — no restarts, no vendor fees, no black boxes.

Browse and install skills from the community marketplace — web search, crypto monitoring, social posting, data analysis and more. Or build your own and share it with the world.

Think of it as the infrastructure layer for AI agents. You own it. You control it. The community builds on top of it.

## Why ZERO AGENT?

The AI agent ecosystem is moving fast — but most platforms are closed, expensive, and owned by big companies. You're renting intelligence, not owning it.

We believe agents should be:
- **Open** — no proprietary lock-in, full source available
- **Free** — self-host at zero cost, forever
- **Modular** — install only the skills you need
- **Community driven** — built by and for developers

---

## How it works

ZERO AGENT is built around one simple idea: **a base agent that can run any skill.**

```
ZERO AGENT (base)
    ↓
Install skills
    ↓
Agent runs tasks
    ↓
Add / update / remove skills anytime
```

Skills are modular packages — web search, data analysis, social posting, crypto monitoring, anything. The community builds them. You install what you need.
